<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>I</h2>

<p>If in my childhood I had been asked to give the name
of an Irish poem, I should certainly have said &#8220;Let
Erin remember the days of old,&#8221; or &#8220;Rich
and rare were the gems she wore&#8221;; for although
among the ornamental books that lay on the round drawingroom
table, the only one of Moore&#8217;s was <i>Lalla
Rookh</i>, some guest would now and then sing one
of his melodies at the piano; and I can remember vexing
or trying to vex my governess by triumphant mention
of Malachi&#8217;s collar of gold, she no doubt as
well as I believing the &#8220;proud invader&#8221;
it was torn from to have been, like herself, an English
one. A little later I came to know other verses, ballads
 nearer to the tradition of the country than Moore&#8217;s
faint sentiment. For a romantic love of country had
awakened in me, perhaps through the wide beauty of
my home, from whose hillsides  I could see the mountain
of Burren and Iar Connacht, and at sunset the silver
western sea; or it maybe through the half revealed
sympathy of my old nurse for the rebels whose cheering
she remembered when the French landed at Killala in
&#8217;98; or perhaps but through the natural  breaking
of a younger child of the house from the conservatism
of her elders. So when we were taken sometimes as a
treat the five mile drive to our market town, Loughrea,
I would, on tiptoe at the counter, hold up the six
pence earned by saying without a mistake my Bible
lesson on the Sunday, and the old stationer, looking
down through his spectacles would give me what I wanted
saying that I was his best customer for Fenian books;
and one of my sisters, rather doubtfully consenting
to my choice of <i>The Spirit of the Nation</i>
for a birthday present, qualified the gift by copying
into it &#8220;Patriotism is the last refuge of a
scoundrel.&#8221; I have some of them by me yet, the
little books in gay paper or in green cloth, and some
verses in them seem to me no less moving than in those
early days, such as Davis&#8217;s lament.</p>

<blockquote><p>We thought you would not die, we
were sure you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not go<br>
And leave us in our utmost need to Cromwell&#8217;s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cruel blow;<br>
Sheep without a shepherd when the snow shuts out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sky,<br>
O why did you leave us Owen?   Why did you die?</p></blockquote>

<p>And if some others are little more than a catalogue,
unmusical, as:&#8212;&#173;</p>

<blockquote><p>Now to begin to name them I&#8217;ll
continue in a direct<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line,<br>
There&#8217;s John Mitchell, Thomas Francis Meagher<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and also William Smith O&#8217;Brien;<br>
John Martin and O&#8217;Donoghue, Erin sorely feels<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their loss,<br>
And to complete their number I will include<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&#8217;Donovan Ross&#8212;&#173;</p></blockquote>

<p>yet there is in them a certain dignity, an intensity
 born of continuity of purpose; they are roughly hammered
links in a chain of unequal workmanship, but stretching
back through the centuries to the Munster poets of
the days of Elizabeth, advised by Spenser to harry
them out of Ireland. The names change from age to age,
that is all. The verses of the seventeenth century
hallow those of MacCarthys and Fitzgeralds  who fought
for the Stuarts or &#8220;knocked obedience out of
the Gall&#8221;; the eighteenth ended with the rebels
of &#8217;98; the nineteenth had Emmet and Mitchell
and its Manchester martyrs. Already in these early
days of the twentieth the street singers cry out:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mac Dermott, Mallin, Hanrahan, Daly,
Colbert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Mac Bride<br>
All men who for our country&#8217;s cause have nobly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bled and died.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even Yeats, falling into the tradition, has put in
a lyric the names of some of those who died in Easter
week, and through whose death &#8220;a terrible beauty
is born.&#8221;</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>I am glad to remember that through the twelve years
of our married life, 1880-92, my husband and his people
were able to keep their liking and respect for each
other. For those were the years of the land war, tenant
struggling to gain a lasting possession for his children,
landlord to keep that which had been given in trust
to him for his; each ready in his anger to turn the
heritage of the other to desolation; while the vision
of some went yet farther, through breaking to the
rebuilding of a nation. The passion, the imagination
of Ireland were thrown into the fight. I often thought
to find some poem putting such passion into fiery
or memorable lines. But the first I thought worth
the keeping,&#8212;&#173;I have it yet, was Katherine
Tynan&#8217;s lament for Parnell, written two years
after his death. In tearing it from the corner of
some newspaper I had unwittingly taken note of almost
the moment of a new impulse in literature, in poetry.
For with that death, the loss of that dominant personality,
and in the quarrel that followed, came the disbanding
of an army, the unloosing of forces, the setting free
of the imagination of Ireland.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>Once in my childhood I had been eager to learn Irish;
I thought to get leave to take lessons from an old
Scripture-reader who spent a part of his time in the
parish of Killinane, teaching such scholars as he could
find to read their own language in the hope that they
might turn to the only book then being printed in
Irish, the Bible. But my asking, timid with the fear
of mockery, was unheeded. Yet I missed but by a little
an opportunity that might have made me a real Irish
scholar, and not as I am, imperfect, stumbling. For
a kinsman learned in the language, the translator
of the wonderful <i>Silva Gaedelica</i> had been
sometimes a guest in the house, and would still have
been welcomed there but that my mother, who had a
great dislike to the marriage of cousins had fancied
he was taking a liking to one of my elder sisters;
and with that suspicion the &#8220;winged nymph, Opportunity&#8221;
 had passed from my reach. After my marriage I bought
a grammar and worked at it for a while with the help
of a gardener. But it was difficult and my teacher
was languid, suspecting  it may be some hidden mockery,
for those were the days before Irish became the fashion.
It was not till a dozen or more years later, and after
my husband&#8217;s death, that my son, having won
the classical entrance scholarship  at Harrow, took
a fancy to learn a nearer language, and rode over
to Tillyra before breakfast  one morning to ask our
neighbour Edward Martyn to help him to a teacher. He
came back without what he had sought, but with the
gift of a fine old Irish Bible, which became a help
in our early lessons. For we set to work together,
and I found the task a light one in comparison with
those first attempts. For that young priest, Father
Eugene O&#8217;Growney, sent from Ireland to look
for health in California, had used the short space
of life left to him in writing simple lessons in Irish
grammar, that made at least the first steps easy.
And another thing had happened. Dr. Douglas Hyde,
<i>An Craoibhin,</i> had founded the Gaelic League,
and through it country people were gathered together
 in the Irish speaking places to give the songs and
poems, old and new, kept in their memory. This discovery,
this disclosure of the folk learning, the folk poetry,
the ancient tradition,  was the small beginning of
a weighty change. It was an upsetting of the table
of values, an astonishing excitement. The imagination
 of Ireland had found a new homing place.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>My own imagination was aroused. I was becoming conscious
of a world close to me and that I had been ignorant
of. It was not now in the corners of newspapers I
looked for poetic emotion, nor even to the singers
in the streets. It was among farmers and potato diggers
and old men in workhouses and beggars at my own door
that I found what was beyond these and yet farther
beyond that drawingroom poet of my childhood in the
expression of love, and grief, and the pain of parting,
that are the disclosure  of the individual soul.</p>

<p>An Aran man, repeating to me <i>The Grief of a Girl&#8217;s
Heart</i> in Irish told me it was with that song
his mother had often sung him to sleep as a child.
It was from an old woman who had known Mary Hynes and
who said of her &#8220;The sun and the moon never shone
upon anything so handsome&#8221; that I first heard
Raftery&#8217;s song of praise of her, &#8220;The
pearl that was at Ballylee,&#8221; a song &#8220;that
has gone around the world &#38; as far as America.&#8221;
It was in a stonecutter&#8217;s house where I went
to have a headstone made for Raftery&#8217;s grave
that I found a manuscript book of his poems, written
out in the clear beautiful Irish characters.  It was
to a working farmer&#8217;s house I walked on many
a moonlit evening with the manuscript that his greater
knowledge helped me to understand and by his hearth
that I read for the first time the <i>Vision of
Death</i> and the <i>Lament for O&#8217;Daly.</i>
After that I met with many old people who had in the
days before the Famine seen or talked with the wandering
poet who was in the succession of those who had made
and recited their lyrics on the Irish roads before
Chaucer wrote.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p>And so I came by the road nearest me to the old legends,
the old heroic poems. It was a man of a hundred years
who told me the story of Cuchulain&#8217;s fight with
his own son, the son of Aoife, and how the young man
as he lay dying had reproached him and said &#8220;Did
you not see how I threw every spear fair and easy
at you, and you threw your spear hard and wicked at
me? And I did not come out to tell my name to one or
to two but if I had told it to anyone in the whole
world, I would soonest tell it to your pale face.&#8221;
Deirdre&#8217;s beauty &#8220;that brought the Sons
of Usnach to their death&#8221; comes into many of
the country songs. Grania of the yet earlier poems
is not so well thought of. An old basket-maker said
scornfully &#8220;Many would tell you she slept under
the cromlechs but I don&#8217;t believe that, and
she a king&#8217;s daughter.  And I don&#8217;t believe
she was handsome, either. If she was, why would she
have run away?&#8221; And another said &#8220;Finn
had more wisdom than all the men of the world, but
he wasn&#8217;t wise enough to put a bar on Grania.&#8221;
I was told in many places of Osgar&#8217;s bravery
and Goll&#8217;s strength and Conan&#8217;s bitter
tongue, and the arguments of Oisin and Patrick. And
I have often been given the story of Oisin&#8217;s
journey  to Tir-nan-Og, the Country of the Young,
that is, as I am told, &#8220;a fine place and everything
that is good is in it. And if anyone is sent there
for a minute he will want to stop in it, and twenty
years will seem to him like one half hour;&#8221; and
&#8220;they say Tir-nan-Og is there yet, and so it
may be in any place.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>In the ancient times the poets told of this Country
of the Young, with its trees bearing fruit and blossom
at the one time; its golden apples that gave lasting
life; its armies &#8220;that go out in good order,
ahead of their beautiful king, marching among blue
spears scattering their enemies, an army with high
looks, rushing, avenging;&#8221; before news had come
to Ireland, of the Evangelist&#8217;s vision of the
Tree of Life and of the &#8220;white horse, and he
that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given to
him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.&#8221;
They had told of the place &#8220;where delight is
common, and music&#8221; before saintly Columcille
on the night of the Sabbath of rest &#8220;reached
to the troops of the archangels and the plain where
music has not to be born.&#8221; But in later days
religion, while offering abundant pictures of an after
world of punishment, &#8220;the flagstone of pain,&#8221;
&#8220;the cauldron that is boiling for ever,&#8221;
the fire the least flame of which is &#8220;bigger
than fifteen hundred of turf,&#8221; so that Oisin
listening to St. Patrick demands a familiar weapon,
an iron flail, to beat down such familiar terrors,
has left Heaven itself far off, mysterious, intangible,
without earthly similes or foreshadowings.  I think
it is perhaps because of this that the country poets
of to-day and yesterday have put their dream, their
vision of the Delectable Mountains, of the Land of
Promise, into exaggerated  praise of places dear to
them. Raftery sees something beyond the barren Mayo
bogs when he tells of that &#8220;fine place without
fog falling, a blessed place that the sun shines on,
and the wind does not rise there or anything of the
sort,&#8221; and where as he says in another poem
&#8220;logwood and mahogany&#8221; grow in company
&#8220;vith its wind twisted beech and storm bent
sycamore. Even my own home &#8220;sweet Coole demesne&#8221;
has been transfigured in songs of the neighbourhood;
and a while ago an old woman asking alms at the door
while speaking of a monastery near Athenry broke into
a chant of praise that has in it perhaps some memory
of the Well of Healing at the world&#8217;s end that
helped the gods to new strength in their great battle
at Moytura. &#8220;Three barrels there are with water,
and to see the first barrel boiling it is certain
you will get a cure. Water there does be rushing down;
you to stop you could hear it talking; to go there
you would get cured of anything  unless it might be
the stroke of the Fool.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>In translating these poems I have chosen to do so
in the speech of the thatched houses where I have
heard and gathered them. <i>An Craoibhin</i>
had already used this Gaelic construction, these Elizabethan
phrases, in translating the <i>Love Songs of Connacht</i>,
as I have used it even in my creative work. Synge had
not yet used it when he found in my <i>Cuchulain
of Muirthemne</i> &#8220;the dialect he had been
trying to master,&#8221; and of which he afterwards
made such splendid use. Most of the translations in
this book have already  been printed in <i>Cuchulain
of Muirthemne</i>, <i>Gods and Fighting Men</i>,
<i>Saints and Wonders</i>, and <i>Poets and
Dreamers</i>. When in the first month of the new
year I began to choose from among them, it seemed
strange to me that the laments so far outnumbered any
songs of joy. But before that month was out news was
brought to me that made the keening of women for the
brave and of those who are left lonely after the young
seem to be but the natural outcome  and expression
of human life.</p>

<h2><a name="1">The Grief of a Girl&#8217;s Heart</a></h2>

<p>O Donall og, if you go across the sea, bring myself
with you and do not forget  it; and you will have
a sweetheart for fair days and market days, and the
daughter of the King of Greece beside you at night.
It is late last night the dog was speaking of you;
the snipe was speaking of you in her deep marsh. It
is you are the lonely bird through the woods; and
that you may be without a mate until you find me.</p>

<p>You promised me, and you said a lie to me, that you
would be before me where the sheep are flocked; I
gave a whistle and three hundred cries to you, and
I found nothing there but a bleating lamb.</p>

<p>You promised me a thing that was hard for you, a ship
of gold under a silver mast; twelve towns with a market
in all of them, and a fine white court by the side
of the sea.</p>

<p>You promised me a thing that is not possible, that
you would give me gloves of the skin of a fish; that
you would give me shoes of the skin of a bird, and
a suit of the dearest silk in Ireland.</p>

<p>O Donall og, it is I would be better to you than a
high, proud, spendthrift lady: I would milk the cow;
I would bring help to you; and if you were hard pressed,
I would strike a blow for you.</p>

<p>O, ochone, and it&#8217;s not with hunger or with
wanting food, or drink, or sleep, that I am grow-
ing thin, and my life is shortened; but it is the
love of a young man has withered me away.</p>

<p>It is early in the morning that I saw him coming,
going along the road on the back of a horse; he did
not come to me; he made nothing of me; and it is on
my way home that I cried my fill.</p>

<p>When I go by myself to the Well of Loneliness, I sit
down and I go through my trouble; when I see the world
and do not see my boy, he that has an amber shade
in his hair.</p>

<p>It was on that Sunday I gave my love to you; the Sunday
that is last before Easter Sunday. And myself on my
knees reading the Passion; and my two eyes giving
love to you for ever.</p>

<p>O, aya! my mother, give myself to him; and give him
all that you have in the world; get out yourself to
ask for alms, and do not come back and forward looking
for me.</p>

<p>My mother said to me not to be talking with you to-day,
or to-morrow, or on the Sunday; it was a bad time
she took for telling me that; it was shutting the
door after the house was robbed.</p>

<p>My heart is as black as the blackness of the sloe,
or as the black coal that is on the smith&#8217;s
forge; or as the sole of a shoe left in white halls;
it was you put that darkness over my life.</p>

<p>You have taken the east from me; you have taken the
west from me; you have taken what is before me and
what is behind me; you have taken the moon, you have
taken the sun from me; and my fear is great that you
have taken God from me!</p>

<h2><a name="2">A Lament for Fair-Haired Donough that Was Hanged
in Galway</a></h2>

<p>It was bound fast here you saw him, and wondered to
see him,<br>
Our fair-haired Donough, and he after being condemned;<br>
There was a little white cap on him in place of a
hat,<br>
And a hempen rope in the place of a neck-cloth.</p>

<p>I am after walking here all through the night,<br>
Like a young lamb in a great flock of sheep;<br>
My breast open, my hair loosened out,<br>
And how did I find my brother but stretched before
me!</p>

<p>The first place I cried my fill was at the top of
the lake;<br>
The second place was at the foot of the gallows;<br>
The third place was at the head of your dead body<br>
Among the Gall, and my own head as if cut in two.</p>

<p>If you were with me in the place you had a right to
be,<br>
Down in Sligo or down in Ballinrobe,<br>
It is the gallows would be broken, it is the rope
would be cut<br>
And fair-haired Donough going home by the path.</p>

<p>O fair-haired Donough, it is not the gallows was fit
for you;<br>
But to be going to the barn, to be threshing out the
straw;<br>
To be turning the plough to the right hand and to
the left,<br>
To be putting the red side of the soil uppermost.</p>

<p>O fair-haired Donough, O dear brother,<br>
It is well I know who it was took you away from me;<br>
Drinking from the cup, putting a light to the pipe,<br>
And walking in the dew in the cover of the night.</p>

<p>O Michael Malley, O scourge of misfortune!<br>
My brother was no calf of a vagabond cow;<br>
But a well-shaped boy on a height or a hillside,<br>
To knock a low pleasant sound out of a hurling-stick.</p>

<p>And fair-haired Donough, is not that the pity,<br>
You that would carry well a spur or a boot;<br>
I would put clothes in the fashion on you from cloth
that would be<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;lasting;<br>
I would send you out like a gentleman&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>O Michael Malley, may your sons never be in one another&#8217;s
company;<br>
May your daughters never ask a marriage portion of
you;<br>
The two ends of the table are empty, the house is
filled,<br>
And fair-haired Donough, my brother, is stretched
out.</p>

<p>There is a marriage portion coming home for Donough,<br>
But it is not cattle or sheep or horses;<br>
But tobacco and pipes and white candles,<br>
And it will not be begrudged to them that will use
it.</p>

<h2><a name="3">Raftery&#8217;s Praise of Mary Hynes</a></h2>

<p>Going to Mass by the will of God, the day came wet
and the wind rose; I met Mary Hynes at the cross of
Kiltartan, and I fell in love with her there and then.</p>

<p>I spoke to her kind and mannerly,  as by report was
her own way; and she said &#8220;Raftery my mind is
easy; you may come to-day to Ballylee.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I heard her offer I did not linger; when her
talk went to my heart my heart rose. We had only to
go across the three fields; we had daylight with us
to Ballylee.</p>

<p>The table was laid with glasses and a quart measure;
she had fair hair and she sitting beside me; and she
said, &#8220;Drink, Raftery, and a hundred welcomes;
there is a strong cellar in Ballylee.&#8221;</p>

<p>O star of light and O sun in harvest; O amber hair,
O my share of the world! Will you come with me on
the Sunday, till we agree together before all the
people?</p>

<p>I would not begrudge you a song every Sunday  evening;
punch on the table or wine if you would drink it.
But O King of Glory, dry the roads before me till
I find the way to Ballylee.</p>

<p>There is sweet air on the side of the hill, when you
are looking down upon Ballylee; when you are walking
in the valley picking nuts and blackberries, there
is music of the birds in it and music of the Sidhe.</p>

<p>What is the worth of greatness till you have the light
of the flower of the branch that is by your side?
There is no good to deny it or to try and hide it;
she is the sun in the heavens who wounded my heart.</p>

<p>There was no part in Ireland I did not travel, from
the rivers to the tops of the mountains; to the edge
of Lough Greine whose mouth is hidden, and I saw no
beauty but was behind hers.   Her hair was shining
and her brows were shining too; her face was like herself,
her mouth pleasant and sweet; She is the pride and
I give her the branch; she is the shining flower of
Ballylee.</p>

<p>It is Mary Hynes, the calm and easy woman, has beauty
in her mind and in her face. If a hundred clerks were
gathered together, they could not write down a half
of her ways.</p>

<h2><a name="4">His Lament for O&#8217;Daly</a></h2>

<p>It was Thomas O&#8217;Daly that roused up young people
and scattered them, and since death played on him,
may God give him grace. The country is all sorrowful,
always talking, since their man of sport died that
would win the goal in all parts with his music. The
swans on the water are nine times blacker than a blackberry
since the man died from us that had pleasantness on
the top of his fingers. His two grey eyes were like
the dew of the morning  that lies on the grass. And
since he was laid in the grave, the cold is getting
the upper hand.</p>

<p>If you travel the five provinces, you would not find
his equal for countenance or behaviour, for his equal
never walked on land or grass. High King of Nature,
you who have all powers in yourself, he that wasn&#8217;t
narrow-hearted, give him shelter in heaven for it!</p>

<p>He was the beautiful branch. In every quarter  that
he ever knew he would scatter his fill and not gather.
He would spend the estate of the Dalys, their beer
and their wine. And that he may be sitting in the
chair of grace, in the middle of Paradise!</p>

<p>A sorrowful story on death, it&#8217;s he is the ugly
chief that did treachery, that didn&#8217;t give him
credit, O strong God, for a little time.</p>

<p>There are young women, and not without reason, sorry
and heart-broken and withered, since he was left at
the church. Their hair thrown down and hanging, turned
grey on their head.</p>

<p>No flower in any garden, and the leaves of the trees
have leave to cry, and they falling on the ground.
There is no green flower on the tops of the tufts,
since there did a boarded coffin go on Daly.</p>

<p>There is sorrow on the men of mirth, a clouding over
the day, and no trout swim in the river. Orpheus on
the harp, he lifted up everyone out of their habits;
and he that stole what Argus was watching the time
he took away Io; Apollo, as we read, gave them teaching,
and Daly was better than all these musicians.</p>

<p>A hundred wouldn&#8217;t be able to put together his
actions and his deeds and his many good works. And
Raftery says this much for Daly, because he liked
him.</p>

<h2><a name="5">His Praise of the Little Hill and the Plains
of Mayo</a></h2>

<p>After the Christmas, with the help of Christ, I will
never stop if I am alive; I will go to the sharp-edged
little hill; for it is a fine place without fog falling;
a blessed place  that  the sun shines on, and the
wind doesn&#8217;t rise there or anything of the sort.</p>

<p>And if you were a year there you would get no rest,
only sitting up at night and forever drinking.  The
lamb and the sheep are there; the cow and the calf
are there, fine lands are there without  heath and
without bog. Ploughing &#38; seed-sowing in the right
month, plough and harrow prepared and ready; the rent
that is called for there, they have means to pay it.
There is oats and flax &#38; large eared barley. There
are beautiful  valleys with good growth in them and
hay. Rods grow there, and bushes and tufts, white
fields are there and respect for trees; shade and
shelter from wind and rain; priests and friars reading
their book; spending and getting is there, and nothing
scarce.</p>

<p>I leave it in my will that my heart rises as the wind
rises, and as the fog scatters, when I think upon
Carra and the two towns below it, on the two-mile
bush and on the plains of Mayo. And if I were standing
in the middle of my people, age would go from me and
I would be young again.</p>

<h2><a name="6">His Lament for O&#8217;Kelly</a></h2>

<p>There&#8217;s no dew or grass on Cluan Leathan. The
cuckoo is not to be seen on the furze; the leaves
are withering and the trees complaining of the cold.
There is no sun or moon in the air or in the sky, or
no light in the stars coming down, with the stretching
of O&#8217;Kelly in the grave.</p>

<p>My grief to tell it! he to be laid low; the man that
did not bring grief or trouble on any heart, that
would give help to those that were down.</p>

<p>No light on the day like there was; the fruits not
growing; no children on the breast; there&#8217;s
no return in the grain; the plants don&#8217;t blossom
as they used since O&#8217;Kelly with the fair hair
went away; he that used to forgive us a great share
of the rent. Since the children of Usnach and Deirdre
went to the grave, and Cuchulain, who as the stories
tell us, would gain victory in every step he would
take; since he died, such a story never came of sorrow
or defeat; since the Gael were sold at Aughrim, and
since Owen Roe died, the Branch.</p>

<h2><a name="7">His Vision of Death</a></h2>

<p>I had a vision in my sleep last night between  sleeping
and waking. A figure standing beside me, thin, miserable,
sad and sorrowful; the shadow of night upon his face,
the tracks of the tears down his cheeks. His ribs
were bending like the bottom of a riddle; his nose
thin that it would go through a cambric needle; his
shoulders hard and sharp that they would cut tobacco;
his head dark and bushy like the top of a hill; and
there is nothing I can liken his fingers to. His poor
bones without any kind of covering; a withered rod
in his hand, and he looking in my face. . . .</p>

<p>Death is a robber who heaps together kings, high princes
and country lords; he brings with him the great, the
young, and the wise, gripping them by the throat before
all the people. Look at him who was yesterday swift
&#38; strong, who would leap stone wall, ditch and gap.
Who was in the evening walking the street, and is
going under the clay on the morrow.</p>

<p>It is a pity for him that is tempted with the temptations
of the world; and the store that will go with him
is so weak, and his lease of life no better if he
were to live for a thousand years than just as if he
had slipped over on a visit and back again.</p>

<p>When you are going to lie down don&#8217;t be dumb.
Bare your knee and bruise the ground. Think of all
the deeds that you put by you, and that you are travelling
towards the meadow of the dead.</p>

<h2><a name="8">His Repentance</a></h2>

<p>O King who art in Heaven, I scream to Thee again and
aloud, for it is<br>
Thy grace I am hoping for.</p>

<p>I am in age and my shape is withered; many a day I
have been going astray. When I was young my deeds
were evil; I delighted greatly in quarrels and rows.
I liked much better to be playing or drinking on a
Sunday morning than to be going to Mass. I was given
to great oaths, and I did not let lust or drunkenness
pass me by.</p>

<p>The day has stolen away and I have not raised the
hedge, until the crop in which Thou didst take delight
is destroyed. I am a worthless stake in the corner
of a hedge, or I am like a boat that has lost its rudder,
that would be broken against a rock in the sea, and
that would be drowned in the cold waves.</p>

<h2><a name="9">His Answer When Some Stranger Asked Who He Was</a></h2>

<p>I am Raftery the poet, full of hope and love; my eyes
without light, my gentleness  without misery. Going
west on my journey with the light of my heart; weak
and tired to the end of my road.</p>

<p>I am now, and my back to a wall, playing music to
empty pockets.</p>

<h2><a name="10">A Blessing on Patrick Sarsfield</a></h2>

<p>O Patrick Sarsfield, health be to you, since you went
to France and your camps were loosened; making your
sighs along with the king, and you left poor Ireland
and the Gael defeated&#8212;&#173;Och ochone! O Patrick
Sarsfield, it is a man with God you are; and blessed
is the earth you ever walked on. The blessing of the
bright sun and the moon upon you, since you took the
day from the hands of King William&#8212;&#173;Och ochone!</p>

<p>O Patrick Sarsfield, the prayer of every person with
you; my own prayer and the prayer of the Son of Mary
with you, since you took the narrow ford going through
Biorra, and since at Cuilenn O&#8217;Cuanac you won
Limerick&#8212;&#173;Och ochone!</p>

<p>I will go up on the mountain alone; and I will come
hither from it again. It is there I saw the camp of
the Gael, the poor troop thinned, not keeping with
one another&#8212;&#173;Och ochone!</p>

<p>My five hundred healths to you, halls of Limerick,
and to the beautiful troop was in our company; it
is bonefires we used to have and playing-cards, and
the word of God was often with us&#8212;&#173;Och ochone!</p>

<p>There were many soldiers glad and happy, that were
going the way through seven weeks; but now they are
stretched down in Aughrim&#8212;&#173;Och ochone!</p>

<p>They put the first breaking on us at the bridge of
the Boyne; the second breaking on the bridge of Slaine;
the third breaking in Aughrim of O&#8217;Kelly; and
O sweet Ireland, my five hundred healths to you&#8212;&#173;Och
ochone!</p>

<p>O&#8217;Kelly has manuring for his land, that is not
sand or dung, but ready soldiers doing bravery with
pikes, that were left in Aughrim stretched in ridges&#8212;&#173;Och
ochone!</p>

<p>Who is that beyond on the hill, Ben Edair? I a poor
soldier with King James. I was last year in arms and
in dress, but this year I am asking alms&#8212;&#173;Och
ochone!</p>

<h2><a name="11">An Aran Maid&#8217;s Wedding</a></h2>

<p>I am widow and maid, and I very young; did you hear
my great grief, that my treasure was drowned? If I
had been in the boat that day, and my hand on the
rope, my word to you, O&#8217;Reilly, it is I would
have saved you sorrow.</p>

<p>Do you remember the day the street was full of riders,
and of priests and brothers, and all talking of the
wedding feast? The fiddle was there in the middle,
and the harp answering to it; and twelve mannerly
women to bring my love to his bed.</p>

<p>But you were of those three that went across to Kilcomin,
ferrying Father Peter, who was three-and-eighty years
old; if you came back  within a month itself, I would
be well content; but is it not a pity I to be lonely,
and my first love in the waves?</p>

<p>I would not begrudge you, O&#8217;Reilly, to be kinsman
to a king, white bright courts around you, and you
lying at your ease; a quiet, well-learned lady to
be settling out your pillow; but it is a great thing
you to die from me when I had given you my love entirely.</p>

<p>It is no wonder a broken heart to be with your father
and your mother; the white-breasted mother that crooned
you, and you a baby; your wedded wife, O thousand
treasures, that never set out your bed; and the day
you went to Trabawn, how well it failed you to come
home.</p>

<p>Your eyes are with the eels, and your lips with the
crabs; and your two white hands under the sharp rule
of the salmon. Five pounds I would give to him that
would find my true love. Ochone! it is you are a sharp
grief to young Mary ni-Curtain!</p>

<h2><a name="12">A Poem Written in Time of Trouble by an Irish
Priest Who Had Taken Orders in France</a></h2>

<p>&#160;&#160;My thoughts, my grief! are without<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;strength<br>
&#160;&#160;My spirit is journeying towards<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;death<br>
&#160;&#160;My eyes are as a frozen sea<br>
&#160;&#160;My tears my daily food;<br>
&#160;&#160;There is nothing in life but only misery.<br>
&#160;&#160;My poor heart is torn<br>
&#160;&#160;And my thoughts are sharp wounds within
me,<br>
&#160;&#160;Mourning the miserable state of Ireland.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Misfortune has come upon us all together<br>
&#160;&#160;The poor, the rich, the weak and the strong<br>
&#160;&#160;The great lord by whom hundreds were main-<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;tained<br>
&#160;&#160;The powerful strong man, and the man that<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;holds the plough;<br>
&#160;&#160;And the cross laid on the bare shoulder
of every<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;man.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;Our feasts are without any voice of priests<br>
&#160;&#160;And none at them but women lamenting<br>
&#160;&#160;Tearing their hair with troubled minds<br>
&#160;&#160;Keening miserably after the Fenians.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;The pipes of our organs are broken<br>
&#160;&#160;Our harps have lost their strings that
were<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;tuned<br>
&#160;&#160;That might have made the great lamentations
of<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ireland.<br>
&#160;&#160;Until the strong men come back across
the sea<br>
&#160;&#160;There is no help for us but bitter crying,<br>
&#160;&#160;Screams, and beating of hands, and calling
out.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;I do not know of anything under the sky<br>
&#160;&#160;That is friendly or favourable to the
Gael</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;But only the sea that our need brings
us to,<br>
&#160;&#160;Or the wind that blows to the harbour<br>
&#160;&#160;The ship that is bearing us away from
Ireland;<br>
&#160;&#160;And there is reason that these are reconciled<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;with us,<br>
&#160;&#160;For we increase the sea with our tears<br>

<p>My hope and my love, we will go for a while into the
wood, scattering the dew, where we will see the trout,
we will see the blackbird on its nest; the deer and
the buck calling, the little bird that is sweetest
singing on the branches; the cuckoo on the top of the
fresh green; and death will never come near us for
ever in the sweet wood.</p>

<h2><a name="17">Forgaill&#8217;s Praise of Columcille</a></h2>

<p>This now is the poem of praise and of lamentation
that was made for
Columcille, Speckled Salmon of the Boyne, High Saint
of the Gael, by
Forgaill that was afterwards called Blind Forgaill,
Chief Poet of
Ireland:</p>

<p>It is not a little story this is; it is not a story
about a fool it is; it is not one district that is
keening but every district, with a great sound that
is not to be borne, hearing the story of Columcille,
without life, without a church.</p>

<p>It is not the trouble of one house, or the grief of
one harp-string; all the plains are heavy, hearing
the word that is a wound.</p>

<p>What way will a simple man tell of him? Even Nera
from the Sidhe could not do it; he is not made much
of now; our learned one is not the light of our life,
now he is hidden away from us.</p>

<p>He that used to keep us living is dead; he that was
our rightful head has died from us; he has died from
us that was God&#8217;s messenger.</p>

<p>The knowledgeable man that used to put fear from us
is not here; the teller of words does not return to
us; the teacher is gone from us that taught silence
to the people.</p>

<p>The whole world was his; it is a harp without its
strings; it is a church without its abbot.</p>

<p>Colum rose very high the time God&#8217;s companies
rose to meet him; it is bright the angels were, attending
on him.</p>

<p>It is short his life was, it is little used to satisfy
him; when the wind blew the sheet against him on the
sand, the shape of his ribs could be seen through
it. He was the head of every gathering; he was a dun
of the book of the law; he put a flame in the district
of the north, he lightened the district of the west;
the east was his along with it; he did not open his
heart to every company. Good his death; he went with
God&#8217;s angels that came to meet him.</p>

<p>He has reached to Axal of his help and to the troops
of the archangels; he has reached to a place where
night is not seen; he has reached to a plain where
music has not to be born; where no one listens to
oppression. The King of priests has done away with
his troubles.</p>

<p>He knew the way he was going; he gave kindness for
hatred; he learned psalms; he broke the battle against
hunger.</p>

<p>He knew seasons and storms; he read the secrets of
the great wisdom; he knew the course of the moon;
he took notice of its race with the branching sun.
He was skilful in the course of the sea; to tell every
high thing we have heard from Colum, would be to count
the stars of heaven.</p>

<p>A healer of the heart of the wise; a full satisfier
of guests; our crowned one who spoke with Axal; a
shelter to the naked; a comforter to the poor; he
was eager, he was noble, it is high his death was.
We hope great honour will be given to him on the head
of these deeds.</p>

<p>And when Forgaill had made that lament he said, &#8220;It
is a great shaping and a great finish I have given
to these words, and I cannot make a praise beyond
this, for my eyes have been taken from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Aodh, King of Ireland gave seven cumhals for
his name to be given in the praising of Columcille;
and Aodh laid it down to Forgaill that this song should
be above every other song.</p>

<p>But it was after death the reward and the praise were
given to blind Forgaill for it was Heaven that was
given to him as the price of the praising of the King.</p>

<h2><a name="18">The Deer&#8217;s Cry</a></h2>

<p>Blessed Patrick made this hymn one time he was going
to preach the Faith at Teamhuir, and his enemies lay
in hiding to make an attack on him as he passed. But
all they could see passing as he himself and Benen
his servant went by, was a wild deer and a fawn.
And the Deer&#8217;s Cry is the name of the hymn to
this day.</p>

<p>I bind myself to-day to a strong strength, to a calling
on the Trinity. I believe in a Threeness with confession
of a Oneness in the Creator of the World.</p>

<p>I bind myself to-day to the strength of Christ&#8217;s
birth and His baptism; to the strength of His crucifixion
with His burial; to the strength of His resurrection
with His ascension; In stability of earth, in steadfastness
of rock, I bind to myself to-day God&#8217;s strength
to pilot me;</p>

<p>God&#8217;s power to uphold me; God&#8217;s wisdom
to guide me; God&#8217;s eye to look before me; God&#8217;s
ear to hear me;</p>

<p>God&#8217;s word to speak for me; God&#8217;s hand
to guard me; God&#8217;s path to lie before me; God&#8217;s
shield to protect me; God&#8217;s host to save me;</p>

<p>Against snares of demons; against the begging of sins;
against the asking of nature; against all my ill-wishers
near me and far from me; alone and in a crowd.</p>

<p>So I have called on all these strengths to come between
me and every fierce and merciless strength that may
come between my body and my soul;</p>

<p>Against incantations of false prophets; against black
laws of heathens; against false laws of heretics;
against craft of idolatry; against spells of women
&#38; smiths and druids; against every knowledge forbidden
to the souls of men.</p>

<p>Christ for my protection to-day against poison, against
burning, against drowning, against wounding; that
a multitude of rewards may come to me. Christ with
me, Christ before me; Christ behind me, Christ in
me; Christ under me, Christ over me; Christ to the
right of me, Christ to the left of me; Christ in lying
down, Christ in sitting, Christ in rising up;</p>

<p>Christ in the heart of everyone that thinks of me;
Christ in the mouth of everyone that speaks to me;
Christ in every eye that sees me; Christ in every
ear that hears me.</p>

<p>I bind to myself to-day a strong strength to a calling
upon the Trinity; I believe in a Threeness with confession
of a Oneness in the Creator of the World.</p>

<h2><a name="19">The Hymn of Molling&#8217;s Guest, the Man Full
of Trouble</a></h2>

<p>He is clean gold, he is Heaven about the sun, he is
a silver vessel having wine in it; he is an angel,
he is the wisdom of saints; everyone that is doing
the will of the King.</p>

<p>He is a bird with a trap closing about him; he is
a broken ship in great danger; he is an empty vessel,
he is a withered tree; he that is not doing the will
of the King.</p>

<p>He is a sweet-smelling branch with its blossoms; he
is a vessel that is full of honey; he is a shining
stone of good luck; he who does the will of the Son
of God of Heaven.</p>

<p>He is a blind nut without profit; he is ill-smelling
rottenness, he is a withered tree; he is a wild apple
branch without blossom; he that is not doing the will
of the King.</p>

<p>If he does the will of the Son of God of Heaven, he
is a bright sun with summer about it; he is the image
of the God of Heaven; he is a vessel of clear glass.</p>

<p>He is a racehorse over a smooth plain, the man that
is striving for the kingdom of the great God; he is
a chariot that is seen under a king, that wins the
victory with golden bridles.</p>

<p>He is a sun that warms high heaven; the king to whom
the great King is thankful; he is a church, joyful,
noble; he is a shrine having gold about it.</p>

<p>He is an altar having wine poured upon it; having
many quires singing around; he is a clean chalice
with ale in it; he is bronze, white, shining, he is
gold.</p>

<h2><a name="20">The Hag of Beare</a></h2>

<p>It is of Corca Dubhne she was, and she had her youth
seven times over, and every man that had lived with
her died of old age, and her grandsons and great-grandsons
were tribes and races. And through a hundred years
she wore upon her head the veil Cuimire had blessed.
Then age and weakness came upon her and it is what
she said:</p>

<p>Ebb-tide to me as to the sea; old age brings me reproach;
I used to wear a shift that was always new; to-day,
I have not even a cast one.</p>

<p>It is riches you are loving, it is not men; it was
men we loved in the time we were living.</p>

<p>There were dear men on whose plains we used to be
driving; it is good the time we passed with them;
it is little we were broken afterwards.</p>

<p>When my arms are seen it is long and thin they are;
once they used to be fondling, they used to be around
great kings.</p>

<p>The young girls give a welcome to Beltaine when it
comes to them; sorrow is more fitting for me; an old
pitiful hag.</p>

<p>I have no pleasant talk; no sheep are killed for my
wedding; it is little but my hair is grey; it is many
colours I had over it when I used to be drinking good
ale.</p>

<p>I have no envy against the old, but only against women;
I myself am spent with old age, while women&#8217;s
heads are still yellow.</p>

<p>The stone of the kings on Feman; the chair of Ronan
in Bregia; it is long since storms have wrecked them,
they are old mouldering gravestones.</p>

<p>The wave of the great sea is speaking; the winter
is striking us with it; I do not look to welcome to-day
Fermuid son of Mugh.</p>

<p>I know what they are doing; they are rowing through
the reeds of the ford of Alma; it is cold is the place
where they sleep.</p>

<p>The summer of youth where we were has been spent along
with its harvest; winter age that drowns everyone,
its beginning has come upon me.</p>

<p>It is beautiful was my green cloak, my king liked
to see it on me; it is noble was the man that stirred
it, he put wool on it when it was bare.</p>

<p>Amen, great is the pity; every acorn has to drop.
After feasting with shining candles, to be in the
darkness of a prayer-house.</p>

<p>I was once living with kings, drinking mead and wine;
to-day I am drinking whey-water among withered old
women.</p>

<p>There are three floods that come up to the dun of
Ard-Ruide: a flood of fighting-men, a flood of horses,
a flood of the hounds of Lugaidh&#8217;s son.</p>

<p>The flood-wave and the two swift ebb-tides; what the
flood-wave brings you in, the ebb-wave sweeps out
of your hand.</p>

<p>The flood-wave and the second ebb-tide; they have
all come as far as me, the way that I know them well.</p>

<p>The flood-tide will not reach to the silence of my
kitchen; though many are my company in the darkness,
a hand has been laid upon them all.</p>

<p>My flood-tide! It is well I have kept my knowledge.
It is Jesus Son of Mary keeps me happy at the ebb-tide.</p>

<p>It is far is the island of the great sea where the
flood reaches after the ebb: I do not look for floods
to reach to me after the ebb-tide.</p>

<p>There is hardly a little place I can know again when
I see it; what used to be on the flood-tide is all
on the ebb to-day!</p>

<p><i>Some of the Wonders Told at the Great in the
East of the  World by the Voice of Philip the Apostle,
that Was Like the Laughter of an Army, and With that
No Louder than the Talk of Friend in the Ear of Friend;</i></p>

<h2><a name="21">I.    The Seven Heavens</a></h2>

<p>As to the Seven Heavens that are around the earth,
the first of them is the bright cloudy heaven that
is the nearest and that has shining out of it the
moon and the scattering of stars.   Beyond that are
two flaming heavens, angels are in  them and  the
breaking loose of winds. Beyond those an ice-cold
heaven, bluer than any blue, seven times colder than
any snow, and it is out of that comes the shining of
the sun. Two heavens there are above that again, bright
like flame, and it is out of them shine the fiery
stars that put fruitfulness in the clouds and in the
sea. A high heaven, high and fiery, there is above
all the rest; highest of all it is, having within it
the rolling of the skies, and the labour of music,
and quires of angels. In the belts, now, of the seven
heavens are hidden the twelve shaking beasts that
have fiery heads upon their heavenly bodies and that
are blowing twelve winds about the world.</p>

<p>In the same belts are sleeping the dragons with fiery
breath, tower-headed, blemished, that give out the
crash of the thunders and blow lightnings out of their
eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="22">II.The Journey of the Sun</a></h2>

<p>God made on the fourth day the two and seventy kinds
of the wandering stars of heaven, and the fiery course
of the sun that warms the world with the sense and
the splendour of angels.</p>

<p>Twelve plains there are under the body of the earth
he lightens every night; the fiery sea laughs against
his journey; ranks of angels come together, welcoming
his visit after the brightness of the night. The first
place he brightens is the stream beyond the seas, with
news of the eastern waters. Then he lightens the ocean
of fire and the seas of sulphur-fire that are round
about the red countries.</p>

<p>Then he shines upon the troops of boys in the pleasant
fields, who send out their cry to heaven through dread
of the beast that kills thousands of armies under
the waves of the south. Then he shines upon the mountains
that have streams of fire, on the hosts that protect
them in the plains. Then the ribs of the great beast
shine, and the four and twenty champions rise up in
the valley of pain. He shines over against the terrible
many-thronged fence in the north that has closed around
the people of hell. He shines on the dark valleys having
sorrowful streams over their faces. He brightens the
ribs of the beast that sends out the many seas around
the earth; that sucks in again the many seas till
the sands on every side are dry. He shines upon the
many beasts that sleep their sleep of tears in the
valley of flowers from the first beginning of the
world; and on the sorrowful tearful plain, with the
dragons that were set under the mist. He shines then
upon the bird-flocks singing their many tunes in
the flower-valleys; upon the shining plains with the
wine-flowers that lighten the valley; he shines at
the last against Adam&#8217;s Paradise till he rises
up in the morning from the east. There would be many
stories now for the sun to tell upon his journey,
if he had but a tongue to give them out.</p>

<h2><a name="23">III. The Nature of the Stars</a></h2>

<p>The stars now differ in their nature from one another.
As to the ten stars of Gaburn, trembling takes hold
of them, and fiery manes are put over their faces,
to foretell a plague or a death of the people. Other
stars there are that bring great heat or great cold
or great mists upon the earth, others there are that
run to encourage the dragons that blow lightnings
on the world; others of them run to the end of fifty
years and then ask their time for sleeping. To the
end of seven years they sleep till they awake at the
shout of the blessed angels, and the voices of the
dragons of the valley. Other runs through the six days
and the six nights till the coming of the Sunday; at
its beginning they begin their many kinds of music,
and they fall asleep again till the coming again from
heaven of God&#8217;s Sunday, and with that they follow
the same round.</p>

<h2><a name="24">The Call to Bran</a></h2>

<p>One time Bran, son of Febal, was out by himself near
his dun, and he heard music behind him. And it kept
always after him, and at last he fell asleep with
the sweetness of the sound. And when he awoke from
his sleep he saw beside him a branch of silver, and
it having white blossoms, and the whiteness of the
silver was the same as the whiteness of the blossoms.
And he brought the branch in his hand into the royal
house, and when all his people were with him they saw
a woman with strange clothing standing in the house.
And she began to make a song for Bran, and all the
people were looking at her and listening to her, and
it is what she said: I bring a branch of the apple-tree
from Emhain, from the far island around which are
the shining horses of the Son of Lir. A delight of
the eyes is the plain where the hosts hold their games:
curragh racing against chariot in the Silver-White
Plain to the south.</p>

<p>There are feet of white bronze under it, shining through
life and time; a comely level land through the length
of the world&#8217;s age, and many blossoms falling
on it.</p>

<p>There is an old tree there with blossoms, and birds
calling from among them; every colour is shining there.
Delight is common, and music in the Gentle Voiced
Plain, in the Silver Cloud Plain to the south. There
is nothing hard or rough, but sweet music striking
on the ear; keening is not used, or treachery, in
the tilled familiar land.</p>

<p>To be without grief, without sorrow, without death,
without any sickness, without weakness; that is the
sign of Emhain; it is not a common wonder that is.</p>

<p>There is nothing to liken its mists to, the sea washes
the wave against the land; brightness falls from its
hair.</p>

<p>Golden chariots in the Plain of the Sea, rising up
to the sun with the tide; silver chariots and bronze
chariots on the Plain of Sports.</p>

<p>It is a day of lasting weather, silver is dropping
on the land; a pure white cliff on the edge of the
sea, getting its warmth from the sun.</p>

<p>The host race over the Plain of Sports; it is beautiful
and not weak their game is; death or the ebbing of
the tide will not come to them in the Many-coloured
Land.</p>

<p>There will come at sunrise a fair man, lighting up
the level lands; he rides upon the plain that is beaten
by the waves, he stirs the sea till it is like blood.
An army will come over the clear sea, rowing to the
stone that is in sight, that has a hundred sounds of
music.</p>

<p>It sings a song to the army; it is not sad through
the length of time; it increases music with hundreds
singing together; they do not look for death or the
ebb-tide.</p>

<h2><a name="25">The Army of the Sidhe</a></h2>

<p>Laegaire, son of the king of Connacht, was out one
day with the king his father near Loch  na-n Ean,
the Lake of Birds, and the men of Connacht with them,
and they saw a man coming to them through the mist.
Long golden-yellow hair he had, and at his belt a gold-hilted
sword, and in his hand two five-barbed darts; a gold-rimmed
shield on his back, a five-folded crimson cloak about
his shoulders, and it is what he said:</p>

<p>The most beautiful of plains is the Plain of the Two
Mists; it is not far from this; the men of its army
in good order go out ahead of their beautiful king;
they march among blue spears, white troops of fighters
with curled hair.</p>

<p>They scatter the troops of their enemies, they destroy
every country they make an attack on; they are beautiful
in battle, a host with high looks, rushing, avenging.</p>

<p>It is no wonder they to have such strength every one
of them is the son of a king and a queen; manes of
hair they have of the colour of gold.</p>

<p>Their bodies smooth and comely; their eyes blue and
far-seeing; their teeth bright like crystal within
their thin red lips.</p>

<p>White shields they have in their hands, with patterns
on them of white silver; blue shining swords, red
horns set with gold. They are good at killing men
in battle; good at song-making, good at chess-playing.</p>

<p>The most beautiful of plains is the Plain of the Two
Mists; it is not far from this place.</p>

<h2><a name="26">Credhe&#8217;s Complaint at the Battle of the
White Strand</a></h2>

<p>And Credhe came to where her man was, and  she keened
him and cried over him, and she made this complaint:
The Harbour roars, O the harbour roars over the rushing
race of the Headland of the Two Storms, the drowning
of the hero of the Lake of the Two Dogs, that is what
the waves are keening on the strand.</p>

<p>Sweet-voiced is the crane, O sweet-voiced is the crane
in the marshes of the Ridge of the Two Strong Men;
it is she cannot save her nestlings, the wild dog
of two colours is taking her little ones.</p>

<p>Pitiful the cry, pitiful the cry the thrush is making
in the Pleasant Ridge; sorrowful is the cry of the
blackbird in Leiter Laeig.</p>

<p>Sorrowful the call, O sorrowful the call of the deer
in the Ridge of Two Lights; the doe is lying dead
in Druim Silenn, the mighty stag cries after her.</p>

<p>Sorrowful to me, O sorrowful to me the death of the
hero that lay beside me; the son of the woman of the
Wood of the Two Thickets, to be with a bunch of grass
under his head.</p>

<p>Sore to me, O sore to me Cael to be a dead man beside
me, the waves to have gone over his white body; it
is his pleasantness that has put my wits astray.</p>

<p>A woeful shout, O a woeful shout the waves are making
on the strand; they that took hold of comely Cael,
a pity it is he went to meet them.</p>

<p>A woeful crash, O a woeful crash the waves are making
on the strand to the north; breaking against the smooth
rock, crying after Cael now he is gone.</p>

<p>A sorrowful fight, O a sorrowful fight, the sea is
making with the strand to the north; my beauty is
lessened; the end of my life is measured.</p>

<p>A song of grief, O a song of grief is made by the
waves of Tulcha Leis; all I had is gone since this
story came to me. Since the son of Crimthann  is drowned
I will love no one after him for ever; many a king
fell by his hand; his shield never cried out in the
battle.</p>

<p>After she had made that complaint Credhe laid herself
down beside Cael and died for grief after him. And
they were put in the one grave, and it was Caoilte
raised the stone over them.</p>

<h2><a name="27">A Sleepy Song that Grania Used to Be Singing
over Diarmuid the Time They Were Wandering and Hiding
from Finn</a></h2>

<p>Sleep a little, a little little, for there is nothing
at all to fear, Diarmuid grandson of Duibhne; sleep
here soundly, Diarmuid to whom I have given my love.
It is I will keep watch for you, grandchild of shapely
Duibhne; sleep a little, a blessing on you, beside
the well of the strong field; my lamb from above the
lake, from the banks of the strong streams.</p>

<p>Let your sleep be like the sleep in the North of fair
comely Fionnchadh of Ess Ruadh, the time he took Slaine
with bravery as we think, in spite of Failbhe of the
Hard Head.</p>

<p>Let your sleep be like the sleep in the West of Aine
daughter of Galian, the time she went on a journey
in the night with Dubhthach from Dorinis, by the light
of torches.</p>

<p>Let your sleep be like the sleep in the East of Deaghadh
the proud, the brave fighter, the time he took Coincheann,
daughter of Binn, in spite of fierce Decheall of Duibhreann.</p>

<p>O heart of the valour of the world to the west of
Greece, my heart will go near to breaking if I do
not see you every day. The parting of us two will
be the parting of two children of the one house; it
will be the parting of life from the body, Diarmuid.</p>

<h2><a name="28">Her Song to Rouse Him from Sleep</a></h2>

<p>The stag to the east is not asleep, he does not stop
from bellowing; though he is in the woods of the blackbirds,
sleep is not in his mind; the hornless doe is not
asleep, crying after her speckled fawn; she is going
over the bushes, she does not sleep in her home.</p>

<p>The cuckoo is not asleep, the thrush is not asleep,
the tops of the trees are a noisy place; the duck
is not asleep, she is made ready for good swimming;
the bog-lark is not asleep tonight on the high stormy
bogs; the sound of her clear voice is sweet; she is
not sleeping between the streams.</p>

<h2><a name="29">Her Lament for His Death</a></h2>

<p>Then when Grania was certain of Diarmuid&#8217;s death
she gave out a long very pitiful cry that was heard
through the whole place, and her women and her people
came to her, and asked what ailed her to give a cry
like that. And she told them how Diarmuid had come
to his death by the Boar of Beinn Gulbain in the hunt
Finn had made. When her people heard that, they gave
three great heavy cries in the same way, that were
heard in the clouds and the waste places of the sky.
And then Grania bade the five hundred that she had
for household to go to Beinn Gulbain for the body
of Diarmuid, and when they were bringing it back, she
went out to meet them, and they put down the body
of Diarmuid, and it is what she said: I am your wife,
beautiful Diarmuid, the man I would do no hurt to;
it is sorrowful I am after you to-night.</p>

<p>I am looking at the hawk and the hound my secret love
used to be hunting with; she that loved the three,
let her be put in the grave with Diarmuid.</p>

<p>Let us be glad to-night, let us make all welcome to-night,
let us be open-handed to-night, since we are sitting
by the body of a king.</p>

<p>And O Diarmuid, she said, it is a hard bed Finn has
given you, to be lying on the stones and to be wet
with the rain. Ochone! she said, your blue eyes to
be without sight, you that were friendly and generous
and pursuing. O love! O Diarmuid! it is a pity it
is he sent you to your death.</p>

<p>You were a champion of the men of Ireland, their prop
in the middle of the fight; you were the head of every
battle; your ways were glad and pleasant.</p>

<p>It is sorrowful I am, without mirth, without light,
but only sadness and grief and long dying; your harp
used to be sweet to me, it wakened my heart to gladness.
Now my courage is fallen down, I not to hear you but
to be always remembering your ways. Och! my grief is
going through me.</p>

<p>A thousand curses on the day when Grania gave you
her love, that put Finn of the princes from his wits;
it is a sorrowful story your death is to-day.</p>

<p>You were the man was best of the Fenians, beautiful
Diarmuid, that women loved. It is dark your dwelling-place
is under the sod, it is mournful and cold your bed
is; it is pleasant your laugh was to-day; you were
my happiness, Diarmuid.</p>

<h2><a name="30">The Parting of Goll and His Wife</a></h2>

<p>And when Goll knew Finn to be watching for his life
he made no attempt to escape but stopped where he
was, without food, without drink, and he blinded with
the sand that was blowing into his eyes.</p>

<p>And his wife came to a rock where she could speak
with him, and she called to him to come to her. &#8220;Come
over to me,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and it is a pity
you to be blinded where you are, on the rocks of the
waste sea, with no drink but the salt water, a man
that was first in every fight. And come now to be
sleeping beside me,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and in
place of the hard sea-water I will nourish you from
my own breast, and it is I will do your healing,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;for it is seven years since you wedded
with me, and from that night to this night I never
got a hard word from you. And the gold of your hair
is my desire for ever,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
do not stop withering there like an herb in the winter-time,
and my heart black with grief within me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Goll would not leave the spot where he was for
all she could say. &#8220;It is best as it is,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I never took the advice of a woman
east or west, and I never will take it. And O sweet-voiced
queen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what ails you to be
fretting after me; and remember now your silver and
your gold, and your silks and stuffs, and remember
the seven hounds I gave you at Cruadh Ceirrge, and
every one of them without slackness till he has killed
the deer. And do not be crying tears after  me, queen
with the white hands,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but remember
your constant lover, Aodh, the son of the best woman
of the world, that came out from Spain asking for
you, and that I fought at Corcar-an-Deirg. And go to
him now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for it is bad when
a woman is in want of a good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he lay down on the rocks, and at the end of twelve
days he died. And his wife keened him there, and made
a great lamentation for her husband that had such
a great name, and that was the second best of the
Fenians of Ireland.</p>

<h2><a name="31">The Death of Osgar</a></h2>

<p>And after a while, at noonday, they saw Finn coming
towards them, and what was left of the Sun-banner
raised on a spear-shaft. All of them saluted Finn
then, but he made no answer, and he came up to the
hill where Osgar was. And when Osgar saw him coming
he saluted him, and he said, &#8220;I have got my
desire in death, Finn of the sharp arms.&#8221; And
Finn said, &#8220;It is worse the way you were, my
son, on the day of the battle at Ben Edair, when the
wild geese could swim on your breast, and it was my
hand that gave you healing.&#8221; &#8220;There can
no healing be done for me now for ever,&#8221; said
Osgar, &#8220;since the King of Ireland put the spear
of seven spells through my body.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Finn said, &#8220;it is a pity it was not I myself
fell in sunny scarce Gabhra, and you going east and
west at the head of the Fenians.&#8221; &#8220;And
if it was yourself fell in the battle,&#8221; said
Osgar, &#8220;you would not hear me keening after
you; for no man ever knew any heart in me,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but a heart of twisted horn, and it covered
with iron. But the howling of the dogs beside me,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and the keening of the old fighting
men and the crying of the women one after another,
those are the things that are vexing me.&#8221; And
Finn said: &#8220;child of my child, calf of my calf,
white and slender, it is a pity the way you are. And
my heart is starting like a deer,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I am weak after you and after the Fenians
of Ireland. And misfortune has followed us,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and farewell now to battles and to
a great name, and farewell to taking tributes; for
every good thing I ever had is gone from me now, "
he said. And when Osgar heard those words he stretched
out his hands, and his eyelids closed. And Finn turned
away from the rest, and he cried tears down; and he
never shed a tear through the whole length of his
lifetime but only for Osgar and for Bran.</p>

<h2><a name="32">Oisin&#8217;s Vision</a></h2>

<p>I saw the household of Finn; it was not the household
of a soft race; I had a vision of that man yesterday.</p>

<p>I saw the household of the High King, he with the
brown sweet-voiced son; I never saw a better man.</p>

<p>I saw the household of Finn; no one saw it as I saw
it; I saw Finn with the sword, Mac an Luin. Och! it
was sorrowful to see it.</p>

<p>I cannot tell out every harm that is on my head; free
us from our trouble for ever; I have seen the household
of Finn.</p>

<h2><a name="33">His Praise of Finn</a></h2>

<p>It is a week from yesterday I last saw Finn; I never
saw a braver man. A king of heavy blows; my law, my
adviser, my sense and my wisdom, prince and poet,
braver than kings, King of the Fenians, brave in all
countries; golden salmon of the sea, clean hawk of
the air, rightly taught, avoiding lies; strong in
his doings, a right judge, ready in courage, a high
messenger in bravery and in music.</p>

<p>His skin lime-white, his hair golden; ready to work,
gentle to women; his great green vessels full of rough
sharp wine. It is rich the king was, the head of his
people.</p>

<p>Seven sides Finn&#8217;s house had, and seven score
shields on every side. Fifty fighting men he had about
him having woollen cloaks; ten bright drinking-cups
in his hall, ten blue vessels, ten golden horns.</p>

<p>It is a good household Finn had, without grudging,
without lust, without vain boasting, without chattering,
without any slur on any one of the Fenians. Finn never
refused any man: he never put away any one that came
to his house. If the brown leaves falling in the woods
were gold, if the white waves were silver, Finn would
have given away the whole of it.</p>

<h2><a name="34">Oisin after the Fenians</a></h2>

<p>Now my strength is gone from me, I that was adviser
to the Fenians, my whole body is tired to-night, my
hands, my feet, and my head; tired, tired, tired.</p>

<p>It is bad the way I am after Finn of the Fenians;
since he is gone away, every good is behind me.</p>

<p>Without great people, without mannerly ways; it is
sorrowful I am after our king that is gone.</p>

<p>I am a shaking tree, my leaves gone from me; an empty
nut, a horse without a bridle; a people without a
dwelling-place, I Oisin, son of Finn.</p>

<p>It is long the clouds are over me to-night! it is
long last night was; although this day is long, yesterday
was longer again to me; every day that comes is long
to me.</p>

<p>That is not the way I used to be, without fighting,
without battles, without learning feats, without young
girls, without music, without harps, without bruising
bones, without great deeds; without increase of learning,
without generosity, without drinking at feasts, without
courting, without hunting, the two trades I was used
to; without going out to battle. Ochone! the want
of them is sorrowful to me.</p>

<p>No hunting of deer or stag, it is not like that I
would wish to be; no leashes for our hounds, no hounds;
it is long the clouds are over me to-night!</p>

<p>Without rising up to do bravery as we were used, without
playing as we had a mind; without swimming of our
fighting men in the lake; it is long the clouds are
over me to-night!</p>

<p>There is no one at all in the world the way I am;
it is a pity the way I am; an old man dragging stones.
   It is long the clouds are over me to-night!</p>

<p>I am the last of the Fenians, great Oisin, son of
Finn, listening to the voice of bells; it is long
the clouds are over me to-night!</p>

<h2><a name="35">The Foretelling of Cathbad the Druid at Deirdre&#8217;s
Birth</a></h2>

<p>Let Deirdre be her name: harm will come through her.
She will be fair, comely, bright-haired: heroes will
fight for her, and kings go seeking for her.</p>

<p>O Deirdre, on whose account many shall weep, on whose
account many women shall be envious, there will be
trouble on Ulster for your sake, O fair daughter of
Fedlimid.</p>

<p>Many will be jealous of your face, O flame of beauty;
for your sake heroes shall go to exile. For your sake
deeds of anger shall be done in Emain; there is harm
in your face, for it will bring banishment and death
on the sons of kings.</p>

<p>In your fate, O beautiful child, are wounds and ill-doings
and shedding of blood. You will have a little grave
apart to yourself; you will be a tale of wonder for
ever, Deirdre.</p>

<h2><a name="36">Deirdre&#8217;s Lament for the Sons of Usnach</a></h2>

<p>As for Deirdre, she cried pitifully, wearily, and
tore her fair hair, and she was talking of the sons
of Usnach, and of Alban, and it is what she said:</p>

<p>A blessing eastward to Alban from me; good is the
sight of her bays and valleys, pleasant was it to
sit on the slopes of her hills, where the sons of
Usnach used to be hunting.</p>

<p>One day, when the nobles of Alban were drinking with
the sons of Usnach, Naoise gave a kiss secretly to
the daughter of the lord of Duntreon. He sent her
a frightened deer, wild, and a fawn at its foot; and
he went to visit her coming home from the troops of
Inverness.</p>

<p>When myself heard that, my head filled full of jealousy;
I put my boat on the waves, it was the same to me
to live or to die. They followed me swimming, Ainnle
and Ardan, that never said a lie; they turned me back
again, two that would give battle to a hundred. Naoise
gave me his true word, he swore three times with his
arms as witness, he would never put vexation on me
again, until he would go from me to the armies of the
dead.</p>

<p>Och! if she knew to-night, Naoise to be under a covering
of clay, it is she would cry her fill, and it is I
would cry along with her!</p>

<p>After that Deirdre lay down by the grave, and they
were digging earth from it, and she made this lament
after the sons of Usnach:</p>

<p>Long is the day without the sons of Usnach; it was
never wearisome to be in their company; sons of a
king that entertained exiles; three lions of the Hill
of the Cave.</p>

<p>Three darlings of the women of Britain; three hawks
of Slieve Cuilenn; sons of a king served by valour,
to whom warriors did obedience.</p>

<p>Three heroes not good at homage; their fall is a cause
of sorrow; three sons of the sister of a king; three
props of the army of Cuailgne.</p>

<p>The High King of Ulster, my first betrothed, I forsook
for love of Naoise; short my life will be after him;
I will make keening at their burial.</p>

<p>That I would live after Naoise let no one think on
the earth; I will not go on living after Ainnle and
after Ardan.</p>

<p>After them I myself will not live; three that would
leap through the midst of battle; since my beloved
is gone from me I will cry my fill over his grave.</p>

<p>O, young man, digging the new grave, do not make the
grave narrow; I will be along with them in the grave,
making lamentations and ochones!</p>

<p>Many the hardship I met with along with the three
heroes; I suffered want of home, want of fire, it
is myself that used not to be troubled.</p>

<p>Their three shields and their spears made a bed for
me often. O, young man, put their three swords close
over their grave!</p>

<p>Their three hounds, their three hawks, will be from
this time without huntsmen; three aids of every battle;
three pupils of Conall Cearnach.</p>

<p>The three leashes of those three hounds have brought
a sigh from my heart: it is I had the care of them,
the sight of them is a cause of grief.</p>

<p>I was never one day alone to the day of the making
of this grave, though it is often that myself and
yourselves were in loneliness.</p>

<p>My sight is gone from me with looking at the grave
of Naoise; it is short till my life will leave me,
and those who would have keened me do not live.</p>

<p>Since it is through me they were betrayed I will be
tired out with sorrow; it is a pity I was not in the
earth before the sons of Usnach were killed.</p>

<p>Sorrowful was my journey with Fergus, betraying me
to the Red Branch; we were deceived all together with
his sweet, flowery words. I left the delights of Ulster
for the three heroes that were bravest; my life will
not be long, I myself am alone after them.</p>

<p>I am Deirdre without gladness, and I at the end of
my life; since it is grief to be without them, I myself
will not be long after them!</p>

<h2><a name="37">Emer&#8217;s Lament for Cuchulain</a></h2>

<p>And Emer took the head of Cuchulain in her hands,
and she washed it clean, and put a silk cloth about
it, and she held it to her breast, and she began to
cry heavily over it, and she made this complaint:</p>

<p>Och, head! Ochone, O head! you gave death to great
heroes, to many hundreds; my head will lie in the
same grave, the one stone will be made for both of
us.</p>

<p>Och, hand! Ochone, hand, that was once gentle. It
is often it was put under my head; it is dear that
hand was to me.</p>

<p>Dear mouth! Ochone, kind mouth that was sweet-voiced
telling stories; since the time love first came on
your face, you never refused either weak or strong.</p>

<p>Dear the man, dear the man, that would kill the whole
of a great army; dear his cold bright hair, and dear
his bright cheeks!</p>

<p>Dear the king, dear the king, that never gave a refusal
to any; thirty days it is to-night since my body lay
beside your body.</p>

<p>Och, two spears! Ochone, two spears! Och, shield!
Och, deadly sword! Let them be given, to Conall of
the battles; there was never any wage given the like
of that.</p>

<p>I am glad, I am glad, Cuchulain of Muirthemne, I never
brought red shame on your face, for any unfaithfulness
against you.</p>

<p>Happy are they, happy are they, who will never hear
the cuckoo again for ever, now that the Hound has
died from us.</p>

<p>I am carried away like a branch on the stream; I will
not bind up my hair to-day. From this day I have nothing
to say that is better than Ochone! &#8220;And oh!
my love,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we were often in one
another&#8217;s company, and it was happy for us;
for if the world had been searched from the rising
of the sun to sunset, the like would never have been
found in one place, of the Black Sainglain and the
Grey of Macha, and Laeg the chariot-driver, and myself
and Cuchulain. And it is breaking my heart is in my
body, to be listening to the pity and the sorrowing
of women and men, and the harsh crying of the young
men of Ulster keening Cuchulain.&#8221; And after
that Emer bade Conall to make a wide, very deep grave
for Cuchulain; and she laid herself down beside her
gentle comrade, and she put her mouth to his mouth,
and she said: &#8220;Love of my life, my friend, my
sweetheart, my one choice of the men of the earth,
many is the woman, wed or unwed, envied me till to-day;
and now I will not stay living after you.&#8221;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
